# Funding Your Wallet

In our previous section you got your wallet set up and linked it to the Telos EVM. In this section we are going to discuss how to obtain TLOS tokens.

The TLOS token is both the governance and resource token of the Telos network and is used for paying gas fees, voting on network wide governance ballots, and managing transaction quota.

## TLOS for Testnet

You can use the [Testnet Faucet](https://app.telos.net/testnet/developers) to acquire Testnet TLOS. Paste your address from MetaMask and press the SEND TESTNET EVM TLOS button. Once completed, you will receive testnet funds to work with and write data to the blockchain.

## Bridging From Other Chains

TLOS is the native coin of the Telos blockchain (like ETH is for Ethereum, BNB is for Binance Smart Chain). TLOS now exists on three blockchains – Telos, Ethereum and BSC. While TLOS is fundamentally used on the Telos blockchain, it is also added on other blockchains for reasons such as liquidity and exposure. They’re pegged 1:1 which means that 1 TLOS on Telos is the same as 1 TLOS on Ethererum (erc20) and BSC (bep20). You can bridge/transfer TLOS between blockchains as per your convenience and needs.

This article describes the two primary methods used to bridge TLOS.

Due to current circumstances we advise against using the Multichain bridge detailed in the article below. There are still other protocols available to bridge to/from Telos.
