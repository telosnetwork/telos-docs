## Bridging From Other Chains

TLOS is the native coin of the Telos blockchain (like ETH is for Ethereum, BNB is for Binance Smart Chain). TLOS now exists on three blockchains – Telos, Ethereum and BSC. While TLOS is fundamentally used on the Telos blockchain, it is also added on other blockchains for reasons such as liquidity and exposure. They’re pegged 1:1 which means that 1 TLOS on Telos is the same as 1 TLOS on Ethererum (erc20) and BSC (bep20). You can bridge/transfer TLOS between blockchains as per your convenience and needs.

This article describes the two primary methods used to bridge TLOS. You will need a TLOS account.
