## Setting Up The App

Install the Decide Voter mobile app [here](https://decidevoter.app/)

As the overall logic of the Telos Decide System also applies to the Decide Voter app, you now need to join the “Telos Governance Token”. This option will only be visible if you did not join the group previously. If you have not joined, you may still explore Telos Governance but voting will fail.

From here you must sign the transaction using Anchor wallet.
