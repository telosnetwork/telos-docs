To learn more about various types of DeFi protocols and the types of projects on the TelosEVM, see below for some simple explainers.

## Bridges 

A bridge is a tool that lets different blockchains communicate with each other.  This enables you to transfer currency or digital assets from one blockchain to another! Because of bridging TLOS, stablecoins, and your other favorite cryptocurrencies can exist on multiple different blockchains!

## DEXs

A DEX, short for decentralized exchange, is a marketplace where you can trade or swap digital assets such as cryptocurrency. DEXs work on a peer-to-peer basis thus eliminating the need for a middleman like in traditional exchanges. 

## Borrowing and Lending

Borrowing and lending involves users leveraging crypto assets as collateral to facilitate loans, with DeFi protocols streamlining the process. Such protocols allow users to engage in borrowing and lending activities without reliance on third-party interventions.

## Predictions Markets

A prediction market is a platform that enables users to speculate on the outcomes of future events. Users can trade predictive assets, typically in the form of tokens, based on their beliefs about the likelihood of specific events occurring. These events can range from sports outcomes to political elections. The use of smart contracts ensures the automated execution of payouts based on the real-world outcomes of predicted events.

## Derivatives

Derivatives are assets whose value is derived from an underlying cryptocurrency asset. This enables traders to profit from the price movements of cryptocurrencies without actually owning the underlying assets. Common types of crypto derivatives are perpetual and dated futures contracts, options contracts, and swaps.
