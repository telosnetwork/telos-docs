# Nodeos

## Introduction

```nodeos ``` is the core servce daemon that runs on every EOSIO node. It can be configured to process smart contracts, validate transactions, produce blocks containing valid transactions, and confirm blocks to record on the blockchain.

## Why run a node 
Running a local node will enable you to test transactions in a truly self-sufficient manner and removes third parties. 

- Local Development node for testing EOSIO contracts.
- Produce blocks for TLOS rewards. 
- Boost RPC callback performance and network security.
