# TocoDeco

TocoDeco is a Latin American artist focused on the space between - where art genres and mediums intersect. Her work is often expressionist, minimalist and experimental.
What We found most compelling is how her work draws on emotionality rarely seen in abstract works. Her body of work suggests an artist on a quest to simplicity, which any artist can attest to is one of the most difficult task.
Her work has a genuine rhythm to it, suggesting much more than complexity would allow. The negative spaces speak volumes against simple line work.
