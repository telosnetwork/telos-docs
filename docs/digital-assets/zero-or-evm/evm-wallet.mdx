# Telos EVM Wallet

___Telos EVM (tEVM) is an EVM running on a Telos blockchain. This allows for Ethereum based dApps to easily deploy on the Telos blockchain with all the benefits of Telos.___

## Metamask

Telos EVM fully supports Metamask, a leading wallet for Ethereum based blockchains.

### Step I - Install Metamask

1. Head over to [metamask](https://metamask.io/download/)
2. Metamask is compatible with multiple browsers, iOS & Android.

:::info
Be attentive to each install tip that Metamask may give.

:::warning
Be sure to save and safely store any and all private keys/seed phrases during the Metamask install.
If your private key/ seed phrase is lost or stolen you lose control over your account and wallet. Please keep your key/s safe!

### Step II - Import The Telos EVM RPC

4. Click "Approve" to add the tEVM network to your Metamask wallet.
5. Click "Switch network" If you'd like to swap over from your current network to the tEVM network.

With the network added you can now enjoy what the tEVM ecosystem has to offer! We are sure you'll love the instant speeds, cheap transactions and the lack of front running.
