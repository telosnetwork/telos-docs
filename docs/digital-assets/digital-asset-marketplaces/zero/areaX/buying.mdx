# Creating an offer/ Buying Digital Assets on AreaX

There are a ton of Telos Digital Assets that we are sure will catch your eye! Let's now show you how to buy an Digital Asset listed or how you can make an offer on an Digital Asset that isn't for sale.

## Browse AreaX Digital Asset and find a collection or item you like.
