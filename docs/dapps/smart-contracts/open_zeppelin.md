# Open Zeppelin Contracts
-----                                   --------
OpenZeppelin provides a library for secure smart contract development, build on a solid foundation of community-vetted code. OpenZeppelin helps you minimize risk by using battle-tested libraries of smart contracts for Ethereum and other blockchains. It includes the most used implementations of ERC standards. You can reduce the risk of vulnerabilities in your applications by using standard, tested and community-reviewed code.

OpenZeppelin brings about:

- Implementations of standards like [ERC20](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc20) and [ERC721](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc721).
- Flexible [role-based permissioning](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/access-control) scheme.
- Reusable [Solidity components](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/utilities) to build custom contracts and complex decentralized systems.
- Checkout More OpenZeppelin Resources [here](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/) for getting started with some boilerplate contracts
