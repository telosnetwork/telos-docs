# DApps on Telos EVM

# Launch Your Ethereum DApp on Telos

## Overview

This document aims to help developers launch their existing dApps on Telos. In this section, you will find a series of resources that will detail:

- The basics of the Telos platform.
- How to connect to the network. 
- How to use your existing tools and environments in developing and deploying on Telos. 
- Common pitfalls you may encounter when running your dapp on Telos.

## Platform Basics

Telos EVM is an implementation of the Ethereum EVM. It is written as a smart contract in EOSIO(C++) and runs on top of the native network. DApps built on the Telos EVM will run similarly to how they run on Ethereum, but with several key differences; namely, tEVM will execute transactions orders of magnitude faster and cheaper than on Ethereum. 

## Accessing Telos 

There are several ways developers can connect with Telos, as seen below:
