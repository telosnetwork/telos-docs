As the overall logic of the Telos Decide System also applies to the Decide Voter app, you now need to join the “Telos Governance Token”. This option will only be visible if you did not join the group previously. If you have not joined, you may still explore Telos Governance but voting will fail.

From here you must sign the transaction using anchor.

Powering up your account (Optional) 

For those of you that have rarely interacted with the native Telos blockchain, either because you are jumping over from Telos EVM or just created a new account, you may have to add CPU, NET or RAM to make it fully operational and gain access to the virtual feeless Telos network.

This is how you can add resources to your account using Anchor Wallet on Desktop.

We usually recommend approximately 0.25–0.5 TLOS RAM and a minimum staked amount of 0.25–0.50 TLOS for CPU and NET. If your account is “brand new”, please note that you will have to purchase RAM before you can stake CPU/NET due to our resource model.

- RAM, NET, and CPU are needed to terminate the vote action
- We will be only using 0.75–1.5 TLOS for the network resources
- In Anchor Wallet, as seen in the image below, purchase 0.25 TLOS RAM and Stake 0.25 TLOS into CPU and NET. Then you will be ready to vote!
- NOTE: You can also obtain RAM, CPU, and NET on one of the Telos block explorers
