Following Signers/Wallets are currently supported:

#### Log in with Anchor Wallet   
While other options are available, we are focusing on Anchor for this tutorial.  

- After you click the Anchor icon, it will prompt you to Launch Anchor.  
- Once you launch Anchor, there will be an identity request sent. Sign the identity request in your wallet that pops up then you will be logged in. Please note that both the Anchor desktop and mobile wallets are supported.

- __NOTE:__ In very rare cases, you may need to reset/reboot your Anchor wallet if there is no signing request.

#### Click “DAOs” to Register as a Voter

The Telos Decide engine supports various entities and groups, also called DAOs, that can utilize our governance tools for their purpose. The flexibility makes it a preferred tool for DAOs or projects that would like to hear a community voice.

__Due to this great functionality, you will have to join the “Telos Governance Token” group to register as a voter once per account.__

![app-telos-net dao group view unregistered](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39388424/191971608-cc5a945e-1518-4fc8-b45a-0133fa4878be.png)

__Click the Register Button under Telos Governance Token__

This will request a signature of the Anchor Wallet, please confirm to add you to the Governance Token Group.

__Please note:__ If your account is “fresh” or you are missing required resources, this may result in an error message. Please refer to [How to manage RAM](https://github.com/telosnetwork/telos-docs/blob/master/docs/learn/resource_management_guide/ram.md) and [How to manage CPU and NET](https://github.com/telosnetwork/telos-docs/blob/master/docs/learn/resource_management_guide/cpu-net.md). This will resolve the issues in most instances.
