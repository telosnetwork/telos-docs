# Liquid Staking on EVM (sTLOS)

__A guide on how to stake TLOS on EVM for the sTLOS receipt token. We are in the UAT phase so this is not in effect on mainnet yet. Follow the guide and provide feedback.__

-------   --                    ------

## What we are doing here
In this guide we will stake TLOS for sTLOS(receipt token) on [Teloscan](http://teloscan.io).

## Why stake TLOS for sTLOS?
- Staked sTLOS helps you put your staked TLOS to work in Defi and explore additional yield opportunities.
- Helps lock TVL on EVM enabeling more attraction for investors and Dapps building on Telos. 

> Disclaimer: Having sTLOS on the tEVM does not allow you to vote in governance processes (including block producers and worker proposals) - these are limited to the native network. Stake on Native to participate in Defi. Stake on EVM for receipt token and more yield opportunties. It's simple ask yourself this question: why am I staking? What is my defi play(have a plan), as there is a 3-5 day locking period.

 > After staking your sTLOS, it will be locked up and earning rewards on a fixed interval (TBA).
 
**Steps to unstake and claim your TLOS and rewards**
First we unstake which will be a 10 minute waiting period until we can then claim our staked TLOS and rewards.

#### Unstake

What is going on here is we are giving back our receipt (sTLOS tokens) to the smart contract. Then a waiting period is taken to provide the Telos rewards for the user to claim in the next step.
