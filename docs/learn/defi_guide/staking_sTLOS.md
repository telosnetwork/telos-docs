# Liquid Staking on EVM (sTLOS) - UAT Guide

__A guide on how to stake TLOS on EVM for the sTLOS receipt token. We are in the UAT phase so this is not in effect on mainnet yet. Follow the guide and provide feedback.__

For UAT testers please follow the testing scenarios. Try to stake and unstake as many times as you are willing to. Please let us know your opinion on UI and provide your overall experience when staking Telos on EVM. If there is anything that you think missing or would benefit our end-users let us know in the Telegram channel. This is very exciting for the future development of the Telos Defi ecosystem. Let's set this off here. 

-------   --                    ------

## Purpose
In this guide we will stake TLOS for sTLOS(receipt token) on [Teloscan](http://teloscan.io). We are pushing for a few days of rigorous testing and feedback from our UAT particpants. 

### Testing Scenarios

- Connect to website
- Please stake several smaller positions and monitor behaviour
- Unstake several smaller positions
- wait some minutes and unstake further positions
- Claim earlier positions when matured, all should be claimed excepted those that are not matured, yet

### Why stake TLOS for sTLOS?
- Staked sTLOS helps you put your staked TLOS to work in Defi and explore additional yield opportunities.
- Helps lock TVL on EVM enabeling more attraction for investors and Dapps building on Telos. 

>   Disclaimer: Having sTLOS on the tEVM does not allow you to vote in governance processes (including block producers and worker proposals) - these are limited to the native network. Stake on Native to participate in Defi. Stake on EVM for receipt token and more yield opportunties. It's simple ask yourself this question: why am I staking? What is my defi play(have a plan), as there is a 3-5 day locking period.
