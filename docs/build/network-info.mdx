## TelosEVM 1.5 Upgrade

We are currently in the process of deploying a major upgrade to TelosEVM, transitioning from version 1.0 to version 1.5. 
This upgrade includes enhancements to various EVM RPC endpoints, resulting in block hashes changes.
Once complete, the version 1.5 upgrade will result in better feature compatibility and improve performance for both users and dapp developers.
