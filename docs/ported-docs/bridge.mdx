# How To Bridge TLOS Between Different Blockchains

TLOS is the native coin of the Telos blockchain (like ETH is for Ethereum, BNB is for Binance Smart Chain). TLOS now exists on three blockchains – Telos, Ethereum and BSC (renamed BNB). While TLOS is primarily used on the Telos blockchain, it is also added to other blockchains for liquidity and exposure. You can be sure that 1 TLOS on Telos is the same as 1 TLOS on Ethereum (erc20) and BSC (bep20). 

You can bridge/transfer TLOS between blockchains at your convenience and needs.

This article describes the primary methods to bridge TLOS. 

You will need a TLOS account. If you don’t have a Telos account, follow these [simple steps](./make-account-replace-link).

Please note that these applications are not developed or operated by Telos.

## The primary methods to bridge your TLOS are:

1. [RocketX](#rocketx) - From any chain, any token to TLOS on tEVM
2. [pNetwork](#pnetwork) - Zero/EVM to BSC/ETH, BSC/ETH to Zero/EVM.
3. Rubic - from BSC to tEVM (from any token to TLOS)
4. Symbiosis - From BSC to tEVM, any token to TLOS.

## RocketX

You can use RocketX to bridge from any chain, or any token to TLOS on tEVM.

1. Go to the [RocketX Bridge](https://app.rocketx.exchange/swap/ETHEREUM.telos/TELOSEVM.telos/100?from=Telos&to=Telos&ref=lkBJrO3y)
2. Select the network you are bridging from and the token you wish to bridge
3. Then select the network and token you wish to bridge to

4. Connect your wallet/signer & approve the transaction

## pNetwork

pNetwork supports the movement of TLOS from Telos Zero to Ethereum and BNBChain.
It also supports the movement of tokens like ETH, BTC, USDC, USDT and a few others from the Ethereum chain to Telos.
This guide will take you step-by-step through the process of bridging/swapping:

- Telos Zero to BSC/ETH
- BSC/ETH to Telos Zero/EVM

### Telos Zero to BSC/ETH

1. Go to [https://dapp.ptokens.io](https://dapp.ptokens.io/#/swap?asset=tlos&from=telos&to=bsc)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Select the coin icon in the ‘From’ swap option, select ‘TLOS - Native

4. On the ‘To’ option, select Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain, whichever blockchain you wish to bridge to.

5. Enter the amount
6. Enter your Ethereum/BSC address.

7. Click ‘Swap’ and approve the transaction from your wallet/signer.
8. You will receive your TLOS shortly (typically 2-5 minutes). Transactions on Telos are instant, but the other blockchain might take some time.
9. Add TLOS as a custom token to your wallet to view the balance.

You have successfully transferred your TLOS to Ethereum/Binance Smart Chain (BSC).  
You will receive your TLOS shortly.

### BSC/ETH to Telos Zero/EVM

Follow the steps below to bridge your TLOS from Ethereum/Binance Smart Chain to Telos Zero/EVM:

1. Go to [https://dapp.ptokens.io](https://dapp.ptokens.io/#/swap?asset=eth&from=eth&to=telos)
2. Select the coin icon in the ‘From’ swap option, select Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain. 
3. On the ‘To’ option, search for ‘ETH on Telos’

4. Enter the amount and your Telos address/Telos account name (typically 12 characters)
5. Connect your wallet
6. Click ‘Swap’ and approve the transaction from your wallet/signer  

You have successfully transferred your Ethereum/BSC to TLOS!  
You will receive your TLOS shortly (typically 2-5 minutes).  
You will be required to pay gas fees (unlike on Telos Zero).
