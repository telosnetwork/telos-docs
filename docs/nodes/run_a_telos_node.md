# Run a Node


__ This section provides a link to the necessary steps to run a Telos Block Producer Node __

The best source of information to run a node is the [node-template](https://github.com/telosnetwork/node-template) repo.
This repo contains scripts for easy management of the node, some helpful readme notes, and the P2P list for both mainnet and testnet.
