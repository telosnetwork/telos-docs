# Telos Cloud for EVM

Incorporating **Telos Cloud Login** into a Telos EVM-based application involves creating an instance of Metakeep and then requesting the ethereum provider to create a `ethers.providers.Web3Provider` for interacting with the blockchain. We'll divide the code into two parts.

## Metakeep Instance

To create an instance of Metakeep with the proper configuration, execute the following TypeScript code:

```typescript
import { MetaKeep } from 'metakeep';
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const email = 'user.address@email.com'; // you take this from google
const appId = 'ad05fb5e-802a-4ae1-18b6-57b9a2626545';
const chainId = 40;
const url = 'https://mainnet.telos.net';
const rpcNodeUrls = {
    [chainId]: url,
} as unknown as Map<number, string>;
metakeep = new MetaKeep({
    // App id to configure UI
    appId,
    // Default chain to use
    chainId,
    // RPC node urls map
    rpcNodeUrls,
    // Signed in user's email address
    user: {
        email,
    },
});
```

## Obtaining the web3Provider

For Telos EVM, we have a solution provided by Metakeep to construct an instance of `ethers.providers.Web3Provider` from an ethereum provider obtained from the newly created instance of Metakeep. 

```typescript
// we create the web3Provider
const provider = await metakeep.ethereum;
await provider.enable();
web3Provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(provider);
// finally we get the user account address
this.accountAddress = await provider.getSigner().getAddress();
```

## Sending a Token

Once the instance of web3Provider is ready, the code to send a TLOS token is straightforward:


```typescript
const to = '0x...';
const value = BigNumber.from(1);
const signer = await provider.getSigner();
signer.sendTransaction({ to, value })
```

## Interacting with a Contract

If you need to interact with a contract and you have the ABI and its address, the code is as follows:


```typescript
// prepare parameters
const to = '0x...';
const value = BigNumber.from(1);
const parameters = [ to, value ];
// prepare contract and method info
const method = 'myMethod';
const abi = [{name: method, inputs: [...], ... }];
const contract = '0x...';
// create a contract instance and interact with it
const signer = await provider.getSigner();
const contractInstance = new ethers.Contract(contract, abi, signer);
const transaction = await contractInstance[method](...parameters);
```
