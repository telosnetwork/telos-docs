# EVM Compatibility

## Overview

The tEVM is generally compatible with any smart contract written in Solidity. Care must be taken to validate throughout the smart contract development life cycle that the contract is functioning as expected. It is always recommended to thoroughly test any contract on the Telos testnet before deploying to the Telos mainnet.

## Solidity Versions

Due to the nature of the Telos EVM's implementation, certain versions of Solidity may not always be supported. Currently, all versions before 0.8.25 should be supported, but version > 0.7.0 is recommended.

## Supported EIPs

As verified by [Sentnl's Audit](https://s3.eu-central-1.wasabisys.com/audit-certificates/Smart%20Contract%20Audit%20Certificate%20-%20Telos%20EVM.pdf) all gas values are consistent with gETH. An explicit effort was made to align the tEVM with EIP-2929 in order to conform with Gas costs. In addition to the Audit verification, all [Open-Zeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts) tests have been run ensuring EVM compatibility.

## RPC Methods

Currently supported JSON RPC methods:

```
rpc_modules

web3_clientVersion

eth_blockNumber
eth_chainId
eth_accounts

eth_getCode
eth_getStorageAt
eth_estimateGas
eth_gasPrice
eth_getBalance
eth_getBalanceHuman // custom, returns the float balance instead of wei
eth_call
eth_sendRawTransaction
eth_sendTransaction
