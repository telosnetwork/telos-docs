# Reading Data From a Contract

## Interacting

On EVM the ontracts may hold data in a private way, which means is not accesible to the public. However, the contracts may have public methods that allow to read the data. These methods are called `view` or `pure` methods. The `view` methods are the ones that read data from the blockchain, while the `pure` methods are the ones that do not read data from the blockchain. Both methods are free to use and do not require any signing.

In order execute a read function, you need to instantiate a contract object and call the method you want to execute. In this chapter we will show how to read the `balanceOf` method from the `ERC20` contract using JsonRpcProvider as the provider for remote access to the blockchain.

### Create the web3 provider

First, we need to create a web3 provider. In this example we will use the `JsonRpcProvider` as the provider for remote access to the blockchain.

```typescript
async web3Provider(): Promise<ethers.providers.Web3Provider> {
    const RPC_ENDPOINT = {
        protocol: 'https',
        host: 'mainnet.telos.net',
        port: 443,
        path: '/evm',
    };
    const url = `${RPC_ENDPOINT.protocol}://${RPC_ENDPOINT.host}:${RPC_ENDPOINT.port}${RPC_ENDPOINT.path ?? ''}`;
    const web3Provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(url);
    await web3Provider.ready;
    return web3Provider as ethers.providers.Web3Provider;
}
```

### Create the contract object

Then, we need to create a contract object. In this example we will use the `ERC20` contract.

```typescript
const provider = await this.web3Provider();
// you don't need the whole ABI, just the methods you want to call
const erc20Abi = [
    'function balanceOf(address account) view returns (uint256)',
];
const erc20Contract = new ethers.Contract(token, erc20Abi, provider);
```

### Call the method

Finally, we need to call the method. In this example we will call the `balanceOf` method.

```typescript
const balance: ethers.BigNumber = await erc20Contract.balanceOf(address);

// you can convert the balance to a number using the ethers.utils.formatUnits method
const tokenDecimals = 18;
const balanceNumber: number = ethers.utils.formatUnits(balance, tokenDecimals);
```

## Conclusion

In this chapter we have shown how to read data from a contract using the `view` methods, prforming a remote call to the blockchain endpoint through the `JsonRpcProvider` provider. You can execute any `view` or `pure` method from any contract using the same approach. All you need is a provider and the contract ABI.
