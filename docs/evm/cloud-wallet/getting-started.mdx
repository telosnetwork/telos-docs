# Getting Started

This is a quick guide to the steps you need to take to get your app connected to the Telos Cloud Wallet in less than five minutes.

:::info
The following information is extracted from the [OreIdAuth class](https://github.com/telosnetwork/telos-wallet/blob/develop/src/antelope/wallets/authenticators/OreIdAuth.ts), which implements all the examples presented in this document.
:::

## Prerequisites

Before getting started you must set up an app with ORE ID through a specific login process to ensure your app will be created in the Telos ecosystem.  

:::danger
If you sign up or create an app through different links you will not be a part of the Telos ORE ID group and your users will not be able to access your app
::: 

To create an app on **Telos EVM**: Click [here](https://oreid.io/developer/partner/new-app?app-group-id=7ec2bdfa-4f3a-47dd-86cd-760c8d905e98) to do so.  
To create an app on **Telos Zero**: Click [here](https://oreid.io/developer/partner/new-app?app-group-id=native7d-aa42-4477-8f15-4e42ae14b937) to do so.  

For a step by step guide on how to create an account, set up an app, and access your developer dashboard see ORE ID's [docs](https://docs.oreid.io/ore-id/blockchains/telos-cloud-wallet/quickstart).

### Installation

For this integration, you will need the `oreid-js` and `oreid-webpopup` packages, which you can install with yarn:

```bash
yarn add oreid-js oreid-webpopup
```

### Importing Required Dependencies

To start, you will need to import the necessary utilities and types from the `oreid-js` package:

```typescript
import { AuthProvider, ChainNetwork, OreId, OreIdOptions, JSONObject, UserChainAccount } from 'oreid-js';
import { WebPopup } from 'oreid-webpopup';
```

### Initialize the library

First, we need to set the configuration to initialize the library. You can specify the app credentials like this:

```typescript
const oreIdOptions: OreIdOptions = {
    plugins: { popup: WebPopup() },
    appName: process.env.APP_NAME as string,
    appId: process.env.APP_OREID_APP_ID as string,
};

oreId = new OreId(oreIdOptions);
await oreId.init();

// here the oreId is ready to use 
```

In the appId property, you need to specify the id from your app configuration which can be similar to `"t_a4d1e1d175197b379929233ec8c42244"` for test nets or `"p_9233ec919741d18c75a4d4e92b374221"` for main nets.

### Authenticating the user

Once the OreId library is initialized successfully, you can open a popup window to authenticate the user using one of the many available providers for the cloud. In this example, we are using `"google"`, which is currently the only available provider.


```typescript
// popup a window to login the user
await oreId.popup.auth({ provider: "google" as AuthProvider });

// after success you will get the user data from this path
const userData = await oreId.auth.user.getData();
console.log('userData', userData);
```

### Sending Tokens

Once your user is authenticated you can try to send some TLOS tokens as follows:

```typescript
const transaction = await oreId.createTransaction({
    transaction: {
        from,
        to,
        value,
    },
    chainAccount: from,
    chainNetwork: ChainNetwork.TelosEvmTest, // or ChainNetwork.TelosEvmMain
    signOptions: {
        broadcast: true,                     // to effectively send the transaction
        returnSignedTransaction: true,       // to get a response after transaction execution
    },
});
const { transactionId } = await oreId.popup.sign({ transaction });
console.log('transaction hash:', transactionId);
```

If you need to implement an interaction with some specific contract, then you may find very useful the next chapter in which we show how to implement the most common actions like sending tokens, staking, and wrapping.

## Integrating ORE ID with Web3 Modal

[This guide](https://docs.oreid.io/ore-id/build/features/web3-modal) provides step-by-step instructions for integrating ORE ID via the Web3 Modal into your Dapp. By following these guidelines, you can enable seamless authentication and blockchain connectivity for your users via ORE ID, enhancing the functionality of your application.
